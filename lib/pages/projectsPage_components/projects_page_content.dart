    'This project focuses on improving battery performance in cold environments. '
        'It involves developing technologies and methods to maintain battery efficiency and '
        'extend the driving range of electric vehicles (EVs) when exposed to low temperatures.',

    'This project aims to create detailed models of battery behavior through advanced '
        'characterisation techniques. By developing digital twins, which are virtual replicas'
        ' of physical batteries, it enables real-time monitoring, predictive maintenance, '
        'and optimization of battery systems.',

    'This project is dedicated to enhancing vehicle safety and driving experience through '
        'adaptive driver assistance systems. It involves the integration of advanced '
        'communication technologies to enable vehicles to interact with each other and '
        'with infrastructure, improving overall traffic management and reducing accidents.',

    'This project focuses on creating a digital twin for electric two-wheelers (E-2W). '
        'The digital twin serves as a real-time virtual model that mirrors the physical '
        'vehicle, enabling better performance tracking, predictive maintenance, and '
        'optimization of vehicle parameters for enhanced efficiency and user experience.',

    'This project explores the development of bidirectional charging systems that support '
        'Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Grid-to-Vehicle (G2V) functionalities. It involves '
        'creating onboard chargers that allow EVs to both draw energy from the grid and '
        'supply energy back to it, facilitating better energy management and grid stability.',

    'This project aims to advance virtual reality driving and enhance connectivity in '
        'vehicles. It involves developing digital twin technologies for realistic '
        'driving simulations and enabling vehicles to communicate with each other and '
        'with infrastructure, improving the accuracy of driving models and the efficiency '
        'of transportation systems.'
